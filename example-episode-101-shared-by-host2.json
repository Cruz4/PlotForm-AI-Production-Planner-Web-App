One minute you're pondering deep AI ethics, the next you're laughing at a cat meme, and then suddenly you're obsessed with growing microgreens on your windowsill? Well, you're not alone! Today on NYN Planner, we're diving into our modern 'Digital Diet' - what we consume, how it shapes us, and maybe, just maybe, how to make it a bit healthier. Plus, I've got a new track that might be trash or treasure, and a viral video that broke my brain.",

I spent way too much time doomscrolling and then tried to compensate by watching a 3-hour documentary on quantum physics. My brain felt like scrambled eggs. It really made me think about curating my digital intake, which ties perfectly into our main topic. What about you, [Host 1's Name]? Any 'brain scramble' moments this week?",
