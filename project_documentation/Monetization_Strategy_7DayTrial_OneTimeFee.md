# PodPlan: Monetization Strategy - 7-Day Trial & Subscription

This document outlines the recommended monetization strategy for PodPlan, focusing on a user-friendly trial period followed by a recurring subscription model. This approach is designed to maximize user adoption, clearly demonstrate the app's full value, and provide a sustainable revenue stream for long-term development and support.

**Model Overview:**

*   **Free 7-Day Trial:**
    *   **No Credit Card Required Upfront:** Users can sign up and experience the **full feature set** of PodPlan for 7 days without needing to provide payment information.
    *   **Purpose:** This is the most effective way to lower the barrier to entry while ensuring every potential customer experiences the "Aha!" moment of the AI-assisted features and the full, integrated workflow.
    *   **Experience:** Full, unlimited access to all features during the trial period, including AI, saving, exporting, and customization.

*   **Subscription (Post-Trial):**
    *   **Single Paid Tier:** To maintain simplicity, a single "Pro" tier is recommended at launch.
    *   **Price Point (Hypothetical, for research):** **$12 / month** or **$120 / year** (offering a discount for annual commitment).
    *   **Post-Trial State:** If a user does not subscribe after 7 days, their account could become read-only, or be limited to only 1-2 active projects, with AI features disabled. This creates a strong incentive to subscribe to continue their work.
    *   **Features Unlocked by Subscription:**
        *   Continued access to all app features.
        *   Unlimited projects, seasons, and custom layouts.
        *   Full access to AI Quote Assist.
        *   All export and sharing options.
        *   Ability to create and use custom themes.
        *   Access to full Version History and Workspace Snapshots (Save/Load State).

**Implementation Notes:**

*   **UI Changes Needed:**
    *   **Marketing Page:** "Get Started Free" should be changed to "Start Your Free 7-Day Trial." Descriptions updated to reflect the trial and subscription model.
    *   **Signup Page:** Text added to indicate that signup initiates a free 7-day trial with no credit card needed.
    *   **In-App Upgrade Prompts:** A non-intrusive banner or notification should appear in the app during the trial period, showing how many days are left. After the trial, clear prompts should guide the user to the subscription page.
    *   **Payment Integration:** A payment provider like Stripe or Lemon Squeezy needs to be integrated to handle subscriptions.

**Why this model is recommended over a restrictive Freemium or a one-time fee:**

*   **Demonstrates Full Value:** Unlike a freemium model where the best features (AI) are locked away, a free trial lets the product sell itself.
*   **Higher Conversion Incentive:** Users who have invested time setting up their projects during the trial are highly motivated to pay to continue their work.
*   **Sustainable Revenue:** A recurring subscription model provides predictable revenue to fund ongoing development, server costs, and support, which is more challenging with a one-time fee model.
