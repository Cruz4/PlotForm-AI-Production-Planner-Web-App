# Plotform v.8.0 - Change Log

**Date:** ${new Date().toUTCString()}

## I. Overall Summary

Plotform v.8.0 stabilizes the application by removing the complex and error-prone backend AI features. To compensate and still provide powerful setup tools, it introduces a robust client-side "AI Prompt Generator" and a versatile "Structured Plan Importer" capable of reading both JSON and Markdown files. This allows users to leverage external AI tools for brainstorming and then easily import the structured results into Plotform.

## II. Key Changes & Enhancements

### 1. Feature: Client-Side AI Prompt Generation
*   **Description:** The "AI Prompt for Ideas" feature in the full episode editor (`src/app/dashboard/episode/[episodeId]/page.tsx`) now generates a complete, detailed prompt entirely on the client-side.
*   **Functionality:** This feature requires no backend processing. It creates a context-rich prompt that users can copy and paste into any external AI tool (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to get structured ideas for their projects.

### 2. Feature: Structured Plan Importer
*   **Description:** A new "Structured Plan Importer" has been added to the General Settings page (`src/app/settings/page.tsx`). This feature allows users to quickly add new content to their planner from external files.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **File Support:** The importer now accepts both structured JSON files and Markdown (`.md`) files.
    *   **Content Parsing:** The `parseFileToEpisodeList` function in `src/lib/dataUtils.ts` has been implemented to intelligently handle both formats. It can parse the specific JSON format generated by the AI prompt as well as a simple Markdown structure (using headers for episodes and segments).
    *   **Additive Import:** Unlike the full data replacement tool, this importer *adds* the parsed episodes to the user's existing project, making it ideal for incorporating new plans without overwriting current work.
*   **UI:** The UI on the Settings page has been updated to reflect this new, more versatile import capability.

### 3. Build Stability: Removal of Genkit
*   **Issue:** Persistent and cascading build failures were caused by dependency conflicts with the Genkit (`@genkit-ai/*`) packages.
*   **Fix:**
    *   All `genkit` and `@genkit-ai/*` packages have been completely removed from `package.json`.
    *   The corresponding backend AI files (`src/ai/genkit.ts`, `src/ai/flows/ai-project-planner.ts`) have been cleared of their content to prevent them from being included in the build process.
    *   This resolves the root cause of the recent `npm install` and `npm run build` errors.

### 4. Documentation Updates
*   **BLUEPRINT.md:** Updated to remove references to the Genkit backend and to describe the new client-side prompt generation and file import processes.
*   **Tutorial Page:** The "How to Use Guide" (`src/app/tutorial/page.tsx`) has been updated with a new "AI-Powered Planning" section that explains how to use the client-side prompt generator and the structured file importer.

This update restores the application to a stable, buildable, and deployable state while providing users with powerful, flexible new tools for project ideation and creation.
