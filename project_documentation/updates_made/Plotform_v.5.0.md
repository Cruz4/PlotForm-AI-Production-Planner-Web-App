# Plotform v.5.0 - Change Log

This document summarizes critical updates and fixes included in Plotform v.5.0, focusing on achieving a stable and successful application build.

## I. Build Stability & Configuration Fixes

This version primarily addresses issues that were preventing the application from building and running correctly.

### 1. Critical Syntax Error Resolution (EpisodeForm.tsx)
    *   **Issue:** A persistent syntax error ("Expected unicode escape") in `src/components/episodes/EpisodeForm.tsx` was causing build failures. This was due to an erroneous backslash before a template literal in the `handleGenerateAIPrompt` function.
    *   **Fix:** The extraneous backslash was correctly removed, allowing the SWC compiler (and subsequently Webpack) to parse the file successfully. This resolved the primary blocker for the `npm run build` command.

### 2. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)
    *   **Issue:** After resolving the syntax error, a `PageNotFoundError` for `/_document` appeared. This indicated a potential misconfiguration where Next.js (App Router) might have been incorrectly looking for a Pages Router `_document.js` file.
    *   **Fix:** Ensured that `next.config.mjs` is the primary configuration file and contains a minimal, standard configuration suitable for an App Router setup (specifically, ensuring `output: 'export'` was not inadvertently active, which is not suitable for a server-deployed application). The `next.config.ts` file was also updated to note it's superseded.

### 3. Build Process Normalization
    *   **Symptom:** Errors like "Cannot find module '/.next/server/middleware-manifest.json'" were occurring.
    *   **Resolution:** These errors were symptomatic of the underlying build failures. By fixing the core syntax and configuration issues, and recommending a clean build process (deleting `.next` and `node_modules`, then running `npm install` and `npm run build`), these manifest-related errors are expected to be resolved.

## II. Outcome

With these fixes, the `npm run build` command should now complete successfully, producing an optimized production build of Plotform. This allows the application to be deployed and run as intended.
